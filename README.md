# semantic-markup

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to learn the concept of **REFACTORING** code. The project involved understanding the difference between semantic and non-semantic language for the purposes of accessibility which in turn increases search engine optimization.

Throughout the project I learned how to identify non-semantic language and replace it with **HTML5** semantic language that nested properly within the **```index.html```** and **```style.css```** files, while maintaining the codes original functionality.
