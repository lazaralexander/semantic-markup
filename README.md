# semantic-markup

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to learn the concept of refactoring code. The project involved understanding the difference between semantic and non-semantic language for the purposes of accessibility which in turn increases search engine optimization.

Throughout the project I learned how to identify non-semantic language and replace it with semantic language that nested properly within the .html and .css files, while maintaining the codes original functionality.
