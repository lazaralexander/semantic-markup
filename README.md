# semantic-markup

This is my first homework for Full Stack Web Development

In this assignment we were tasked with refactoring existing code for accessibilty and SEO purposes.

Throughout this assignment I changed the non semantic code to semantic code. This was all done to make the code more accessible to all users and in turn provide better optimization for search engines.
